#### 0_denoising_run.ipynb
##### Run single-subject GLM to denoise the data and estimate the activation for each condition

#### 1_GroupLevel.ipynb
##### Run the group-level analysis to and potential contrasts

#### 2_Behavioral_corr.ipynb
##### subject-by-subject multivariates pattern similarity and its similarity to behavioral measurements

#### 3_reward_signature.ipynb
##### subject-level reward calculates by full/masked reward model and medialogo activation, and the correlations with pmu scores

#### 4_change_across_runs.ipynb
##### to see whether the activation and reward level would change the more times they watched the stimuli (in different runs)
